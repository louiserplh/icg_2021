	<h1 style="display:center">ICG Project: Pretty Houses Generator</h1>
	<p class="group17">A project by Emmanuelle Denove, Louise Rieupouilh and Tom Demont</p>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>In Pretty Houses Generator, we wanted to create an app showing various tiles layout in a 3D world that are
		matching nicely with each other. The main part was the implementation of a Wave Collapse Function to output a
		valid layout of the tiles we created. We also wanted the app to be interactive to let the user discover and
		appreciate a visually appealing layout while having a hand on its creation.</p>

	<h2>Technical approach</h2>
	<p>We decided to create our project using the REGL pipelines and JavaScript to display it in browser using WebGL.
		Indeed we wanted our project to benefit all the WebGL advantages (GPU computation, portability ...) while being
		consistant with the tools we developped along the semester's exercices. From the tiles design to the user
		interface, we wanted to master all the steps of this processus and create a fully functionnal Pretty Houses
		Generator. We based our GLSL and JavaScript implementations of the Exercice 5: Solar Shading.</p>

	<h3>Tiles design</h3>
	<p>For the rendering of the tiles, we used MagicaVoxel [3], which was provided to us by the TAs.
		It was really fun and easy to use and it allowed us to create tiles in 3D for our project. All the tiles and the
		floor were made
		by us and so we had to pay attention when creating a new tile to how it was going to fit the others.
		We created tiles with roof, no roof, with door when the tile was put on the floor, no door and different
		positions
		(middle, left, right, corner).
		This allowed us to have a lot of different possibilities when using the wave collapse function to build a great
		variety of buildings.</p>

	<h3>Tiles rendering</h3>
	<h4>Actors model</h4>
	<p>For the rendering of our tiles, we created the file <code>tiles.js</code> where we took the basis of the
		<code>planets.js</code> actors modelization. We could get rid of the physical (orbit, speed, size) aspects as we
		just wanted to display 3D fixed tile actors. We then created the classes <code>UnshadedTileActor</code>,
		<code>PhongTileActor</code> and <code>MeshTileActor</code>, each one inheritting the former. The only
		modification with relation to the previous <code>PlanetActors</code> is in the computation of the
		<code>mat_model_to_world</code> matrix.
		Indeed, we added <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> attributes to place the tiles in a grid where
		each tile would occupy one cell. This helped us to boilerplate the tiles placing in the algorithms by just
		taking this 3D cells representations. The model matrix computation makes sure to rotate the tile facing the user
		in default position and placing it correctly in the world: our tiles are \(32\times 32 \times 32\)px, observing
		\(1\) unit length is \(10\)px, we created the correct translation matrix:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
		<code>// Matrix to shift the tile on its coordinate (and put it above the ground). 
		//Each tile is 32px large, long and high. 1 length unit is 10px observed
		let placingMatrix = mat4.fromTranslation(
		mat4.create(),
		vec3.fromValues(3.2 * this.x, 3.2 * this.z, 3.2 * this.y)
		);
		// Rotate the tile to avoid put it on its default rotation
		let rotateMatrixX = mat4.fromXRotation(mat4.create(), Math.PI / 2);
		let rotateMatrixY = mat4.fromYRotation(mat4.create(), Math.PI / 2);
		const rotateMatrix = mat4_matmul_many(mat4.create(), rotateMatrixX, rotateMatrixY);
	
		// Store the combined transform in this.mat_model_to_world
		mat4_matmul_many(this.mat_model_to_world, sizeMat, rotateMatrix, placingMatrix);</code>
	</pre>
	<h4>Tiles set to render</h4>
	<p>Updating then the <code>actors_list</code> variable was just done by iterating over a given <code>tiles</code>
		list giving tiles by their id (the prefix name of their object, material and texture files). This list also
		contains the desired coordinates for the tile to ease its placement.</p>
	<p>To add realism, we decided to adapt the shininess and ambient factor to the type of tile. The <code>grass</code>
		tiles were less shiny than our other tiles and more ambiently brillant to compensate the shining loss:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
		<code>function create_actor_list() {
			// ...
			const shine = tiles[i].id === 'grass' ? 1 : 14;
			const amb = tiles[i].id === 'grass' ? 0.9 : 0.5;
			// ..
		}</code>
	</pre>
	<p>The last added point was the rendering of empty tiles. Those are identified by and id <code>air</code>. We used
		the already implemented <code>pipeline_without_mesh</code> implented in the <code>MeshTileActor</code> class to
		render actors without mesh. In the actor creation, an <code>air</code> tile were assigned no mesh nor texture
		while every other tile has its mesh and texture loaded synchronously (with <code>await</code>) and passed as
		arguments to the constructor.</p>
	<p>The remaining parts of the rendering pipeline are similar to the one used in the Exercice 5, using the
		<code>draw</code> function of each tile to render it in the REGL canvas.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="media/tiles_rendering.png" width="50%"><br>
		Example of tiles placed vertically in our world
	</p>

	<h3>Wave Collapse Function in Java</h3>
	<h4>Java model</h4>
	<p>Because it is a language that we are quite familiar with, we decided to implement the wave collapse function in
		Java. We then found a youtube video [4] explaining the structure of the code of this function, which we adapted
		to
		our project.</p>

	<p>The principle of the wave collapse is that for every cell in the world, there is an array of possible tiles for
		this cell. At the beginning, this array contains all tiles that we created. First, the arrays are restricted to
		only contain tiles compatible with their z-position (i.e. cells at z = 0 can only contain tiles that can be
		placed on the floor, and vice-versa for cells at z > 0). Then, a function finds the cell with the lowest
		entropy, hence with the smallest possible tiles array, and calls the <code>collapse</code> function on it. This
		function sets the tile of this cell to a random one within the array of possible tiles. This change is then
		propagated, meaning that this cell’s neighbors adapt their own possible tiles list taking into consideration the
		newly placed tile, and then notify their own neighbors to adapt their possible tiles array (i.e. the cell above
		an “air” tile will also be an “air” tile since buildings cannot float, and that change will be propagated to its
		own neighbors). This process is repeated until all cells have only one tile in their possible tiles array.</p>

	<p>In order for the algorithm to know what other tiles a tile is compatible with, we used the principle of sockets
		(more details on that below). We then create, at the launching of our function, a list of
		<code>TileCorrespondences</code>. These store, for every one of our tiles (stored in the <code>TilesDB</code>
		class), the list of tiles compatible with each side of the tile. This makes it a lot easier to access the tiles
		that can be put in a certain cell depending on the cell’s neighboring tiles.
	</p>
	<h4>Sockets matching</h4>
	<p>Every side of a tile has an associated socket, and two sides are compatible if and only if they have the same
		socket AND are corresponding sides (i.e. the left side of a tile can only be compatible with the right side of a
		tile, not with the top or bottom for example). The sockets were determined manually for every one of our tiles,
		and we currently have 20 different sockets.</p>
	<p>We also introduced the concept of a <code>door_side</code> for tiles. This stores, as the name suggests, the side
		on which there is a door (if any) for a given tile. When creating TileCorrespondences for tiles that have a
		door, the only compatible tile with the door side is the “air” tile. This is because it seemed illogical to us
		to be able to place tiles in front of doors, making the door inaccessible.</p>
	<h4>Client Server Architecture</h4>
	<p>One of the main issues in our project was dealing with both the WebGL displaying using Web coding and the
		algorithm computation. Indeed, we tried to implement the WFC algorithm in JavaScript, but seing the toughness og
		the computation, we prefered to keep our initial working Java version. We then had to initiate a link between
		both applications, and following the ICG team advices, we implemented a client server architecture.</p>
	<h5>Java Server</h5>
	The difficulty of implementing the java server was figuring out which Java library we would use. After some trial
	and error, we settled on HttpServer, which worked the best. We also had some issues linked to security of http
	requests. At first, we wanted the Java server to call the wave collapse function and then send the computed tile
	array to the python server in JSON form. However, with the way HTTP requests are implemented in JavaScript, there is
	a security measure called <code>cors</code> which masks the http request content. This seemed quite complicated to
	override, so we settled on using the http requests only to notify the python server that the tiles are computed and
	can be displayed. The Java takes care of writing the corresponding tile array in JSON form to a specific file that
	the JavaScript then reads.
	<h5>JavaScript Client</h5>
	<p>To query a new tiles set, we set on <strong class="keyboard">g</strong> key the call of a
		<code>query_new_tileset</code> function. To deal with asynchronicity of our requests, we set boolean flags
		<code>received_new_tiles</code>,<code>querying_new_tiles</code> and <code>error_on_receive</code> to indicate
		the state of the query to the rendering pipeline. Indeed, we did not wanted to take the risk to display tiles
		from a list being modified by 2 parts of the program. We then added <code>if</code> conditions in the frame
		computation to avoid manipulating <code>actors_list</code> when the query is not fully complete.
	</p>
	<p>We decided to wrap our query in a GET request, bu the issue we struggled with was the CORS of
		<code>fetch</code>[1] queries. Indeed, we couldn't get without
		authentification the GET RESULT of our query to the Java Server. To handle it, we made the the Java Server write
		its output tiles' layout to <code>tiles.json</code> file. After that, we could load the JSON file and get the
		tiles to display
	</p>
	<p>Finally, we had to adapt our <code>actors_list</code> but also <code>actors_by_name</code>. To do so, we created
		the <code>create_actor_list</code> and <code>create_actor_corner_by_name</code> that was called in the rendering
		pipeline by putting the <code>draw_list = actors_list.slice()</code> line inside the frame computation.</p>
	<p>With this whole process, we were able to, and with no concurrence major issue, call our Java server for updating
		our tiles set to place in world and adquatly render it on the <strong class="keyboard">g</strong> key pressing.
	</p>
	<p>Finally, the user receives feedback on the tiles computation in the debug overlay to be informed if something
		failed or is still being computed, displayed using our flags
		<code>received_new_tiles</code>,<code>querying_new_tiles</code> and <code>error_on_receive</code>.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="media/tiles_feedback.png" width="60%"><br>
		The feedback messages during the WFC query processing
	</p>

	<h4>Constrained computation</h4>
	<p>Finally, we adapted our code to be able to handle and read GET requests where constrainted are specified by
		<code>index</code> (a wrapper for the 3D coordinates of a tile) and an <code>id</code>, the file name of the
		tile we want to set. These constraints were handled easily in computation by setting the desired tile at desired position and propagating the constraints update.</p>

	<h3>Bézier curves camera paths</h3>
	<p>Seeing our visual result getting closer to what we expected, we decided that the extension of the camera to
		follow Bézier curve's path was perfectly adapted to add the smoothness we wanted.</p>
	<p>To do so, we added many parameters with prefix <code>old_</code> and <code>new_</code>. Those ones helped us to
		specify the beginning and end values to be interpolated for the <code>cam_distance_factor</code>,
		<code>cam_angle_z</code> and <code>cam_angle_y</code>. Those ones were not necessary for our pure Bézier curve
		but we decided it would be smooth to also linearly lerp those values with the same time parameter as the
		Bézier's. The visual result is that the camera rotates and goes back/forward whenever we change its position and
		recenters on a nice position/rotation/distance.
	</p>
	<video class="vid" loop autoplay muted src="media/camera_rotation.mp4" width="50%"></video>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Example of rotating and placing camera in linear interpolation</p>
	<p>The key of the Bézier interpolation is the <code>bezier_param</code> that represents the time parameter \(t\)
		that evolves from \(0\) to \(1\). Whenever the user asks for a new position to be selected, the
		<code>bezier_param</code> value is set back to \(0\) and the new <code>cam_distance_factor</code>,
		<code>cam_angle_z</code> and <code>cam_angle_y</code> are put in the <code>new_</code> variables. When this
		value gets back to \(1\), we know our update is done and we just apply the same transformation as before in the
		previous Exercice 5 where camera just centers on a selected Actor.
	</p>
	<p>We decided to put three control point in our Bézier paths as we were very satisfied with the result. Having those
		3 meant that we had to take a starting point, <code>old_selected_corner_position</code>, and ending point
		<code>new_selected_corner_position</code> and a middle point <code>third_point_position</code>. To have a
		simetrical curve and create a curvy effect, we placed this point on the perpendicular bisector of the straight
		line between start and end point. The shape aspect of our curve is displayed below.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="media/bezier_curve.png" width="30%"><br>
		The shape of our created Bézier curve (from the course's web slides) [2]
	</p>
	<p>Once those points were computed, we could solve the quadratic equation using the de Castlejau algorithm [2]:
		$$\textbf{x}(t)=(1-t)^2\textbf{b}_0+2(1-t)t\textbf{b}_1+t^2\textbf{b}_2$$ Where <strong>b</strong> points are
		the controle points. Observing the <code>vec3</code> class, we saw a method computing exactly the desired result
		<code>vec3.bezier(out, a, b, c, d, t)</code>. Observing that putting our third point in place of <code>b</code>
		and <code>c</code> intermediary paramaters results in the same as having one middle paramater, we used it to
		output the desired camera translation at every intermediary points between the old and new camera positions and
		modify accordingly the <code>mat_view</code> matrix in the frame computation. We finally update our time to
		simulate a time effect and make our paramter grow to \(1\).
	</p>
	<p>The visual result looked very nice to us and we liked to move around our houses following thos curves.</p>

	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>We created to part for our user interface: the part for the user to navigate in our world by selecting tiles and
		the part to set constraints on WFC computation.</p>
	<h4>Tile selection</h4>
	<p>For the user interface, we wanted the user to be able to select the tiles to focus on. However, allow her to
		select any tile as there were 75 of them were probably not good for the readibility of our interface. We then
		created the <code>corners_by_name</code> and its sorted version <code>sorted_corners_by_name</code> to be able
		to display the list of corners in the debug overlay. The "corners" are the tiles actors in corner coordinates
		(all the maximized/minimized coordinates combinations) plus the tiles in the middle of the layout on middle,
		bottom and top of \(Z\) axis. Similarly to the Exercice 5's <code>actors_by_name</code> list, pressing the
		buttons sets the viewed corner as the selected one with an adapted camera rotation and distance. The Bézier
		lerping could then start on next frames updates.</p>

	</p>
	<h4>Constraints setting</h4>
	<p>Our final amelioration of the project was setting a tile constraint by the user. We wanted this process to be interactive and intuitive. We created 2 sets of buttons for selecting the tile</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Optimization possibilities</h3>
	<p>Sadly, the computation of tiles can be quite slow. This is due to the randomization process : sometimes, cells
		are
		collapsed in a way that makes it impossible to fill the entire grid correctly, so the algorithm has to re-run
		quite
		a few times (this number completely depends on the randomization) in order to find a valid array of tiles that
		can
		fill the whole grid. An optimization that we had in mind but did not have time to implement was to write the
		initial
		array of possible tiles taking into consideration the tiles that could and couldn't be on the z = 0 plane into a
		local file that can be read, instead of recomputing this array at every iteration of the algorithm.</p>
	<h3>How to launch the project</h3>
	<p>As described above, our project requires Java Server to run to compute new tiles sets. To launch the project,
		please be at the root of the project folder and run:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
	<code>python3 -m http.server</code>
	</pre>
	while in another terminal running:
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
	<code>cd WaveCollapse_classes; java JavaServer</code>
	</pre>
